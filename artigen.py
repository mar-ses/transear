"""
This module takes care of generating artificial K2-like
transiting/non-transiting lightcurves.

TODO:
Define a basic function that generates a randomised lightcurve
with stellar variability and noise, based on a few general
parameters.

For generation, produce a distribution of stellar variability/noise
parameters that matches a specific population of stars and insert
them into the generator function.

TODO:
For a possibly large improvement, make the white noise term vary
(very slowly) in some cases.
